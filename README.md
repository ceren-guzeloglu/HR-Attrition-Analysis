# HR Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes employee attrition data to uncover key factors that influence voluntary employee turnover. Using Power BI, we built an interactive dashboard that showcases insights, trends, and predictive modeling outcomes based on HR data.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Problem**: Employee attrition affects team morale and organizational productivity. Understanding why employees leave helps mitigate future churn.
- **Objective**: Identify patterns in employee data to predict attrition risk.
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, DAX, and custom visuals (e.g., Sankey Diagram, Bar Chart Race)
